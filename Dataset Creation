#Creating the Dataset
The dataset is comprised of three tables: Patient Information, Visit Information, and Billing Information.
All data is generated.



Generation Process:
ChatGPT was used to generate the python script that subsequently generated the dataset.

I designed this synthetic healthcare dataset with ChatGPT as a co-pilot: we debated realistic clinical, operational, and billing rules, then translated them into a single Python generator that produces linked patients, visits, and billing tables plus a validation summary. We separated treatment from medication (with life-like drug names, doses, and frequencies), modeled follow-ups and “Monitoring” (including a small no-show rate for minor conditions), tightened provider continuity (same doctor/hospital preferred; otherwise same hospital or at least same state), and made same-day discharges more common only for mild severities with minor conditions. Billing was kept strictly 1:1 with visits, with sensible coverage and charge behavior, and we moved billing_date into the billing table where it belongs.

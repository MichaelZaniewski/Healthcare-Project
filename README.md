# Healthcare Analytics Project Part 1: Company-Focused
A data analytics project focused on helping healthcare organizations identify inefficiencies, optimize revenue cycles, and improve hospital performance through data-driven insights derived from a realistic synthetic healthcare dataset.

### Background and Overview
The U.S. healthcare system generates massive volumes of data spanning patients, treatments, and billing — yet real datasets are often inaccessible due to privacy laws like HIPAA. This project was created to bridge that gap by providing a safe, realistic environment for healthcare analytics and data visualization.

The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze patterns in care quality, hospital efficiency, and payment behavior using SQL — demonstrating how data-driven insights can improve both operational performance and patient outcomes.

### Data Structure and Info

The dataset simulates how hospitals operate day-to-day: patients are admitted for various conditions, receive treatments of differing severities, and are billed through diverse insurance and payment plans. Each record is generated using probabilistic logic to mimic real-world complexity — from follow-up visits and recurring conditions to late payments and same-day discharges.




### ⚙️ Dataset Generator and Structure Overview




This project includes a fully custom Healthcare Dataset Generator that creates realistic, U.S.-based healthcare data for analysis — entirely synthetic, with built-in randomness so no two datasets are ever the same.

Each dataset models real-world hospital operations through three linked tables: Patients, Visits, and Billing.

Condition, treatment, and billing logic follow medically realistic patterns.

Payment behavior, insurance coverage, and follow-up care evolve dynamically.

All data passes a validation system ensuring consistent ages, conditions, and relationships.

It’s an analytics-ready foundation for exploring trends in patient outcomes, billing efficiency, and hospital performance — without exposing real patient data.
